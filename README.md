# Polynomial Regression

-> This project implements **Polynomial Regression**, a technique that models non-linear relationships by adding polynomial features.  
-> It includes manual polynomial feature expansion and an sklearn-based implementation using `PolynomialFeatures`.

## Contents:-
-> Polynomial Regression **from scratch**
-> Polynomial Regression using **sklearn**
-> Feature expansion using polynomial terms
-> Model training and prediction comparison
-> Visualization of fitted curves

## Key Concepts:-
-> Why Linear Regression fails on non-linear patterns
-> Role of polynomial degrees
-> Underfitting vs overfitting in polynomial models

## Libraries Used:-
-> NumPy  
-> Pandas  
-> Matplotlib  
-> Scikit-learn
